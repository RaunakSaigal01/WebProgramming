    <font size="5">
    <div align="top-left"><img src="prof.jpg" alt="Sunflower" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" width="100" height="150"><p><font color="white">I am someone who thrives on challenges and finds joy in pushing boundaries, whether on the field or off it. As the <span style="font-style: italic; color: purple;">school sports captain of my school</span>, I took immense pride in leading my team with <span style="color: orange;">passion</span>, strategy, and unwavering <span style="color: orange;">determination</span>. Football and cricket have always been more than just sports for me—they are a way of life. Through every match, I’ve learned the value of <strong>teamwork</strong>, <b>perseverance</b>, and staying composed under pressure. These lessons have not only shaped me as an athlete but also as a <span style="color: orange;">leader</span> who inspires others to give their best, no matter the odds.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>Beyond sports,<span style="color: orange; font-style: oblique;">coding</span> has become my creative outlet and intellectual playground. I love diving into problems and crafting elegant solutions, whether it’s debugging a tricky error or designing an innovative program. Each line of code is a reflection of my <span style="color: purple; font-style: italic;">problem-solving mindset</span> and relentless pursuit of perfection. Studying at <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">VIT Vellore</span> has been an incredible journey of learning and growth, allowing me to refine my technical skills while collaborating with like-minded individuals. <span style=" font-style: italic;">Balancing academics with my passions has taught me discipline and time management, two qualities I hold dear.</span></p></div>
    <div><p>Music is another integral part of who I am—it’s where I find peace, inspiration, and the energy to keep going. Whether I’m vibing to my favorite songs or discovering new sounds, music fuels my <span style="color: orange;">creativity</span> and keeps me grounded. This combination of sports, coding, and music defines me as a well-rounded individual who embraces challenges with <span style="color: orange;">grit</span> and creativity. <span style="color: purple; font-style: italic;">I take pride in my journey so far and look forward to the opportunities ahead</span>, ready to face them with passion and <span style="color: orange;">resilience</span>.</p></div>
